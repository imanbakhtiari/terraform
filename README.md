# terraform

#### Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp that allows you to define, provision, and manage infrastructure across multiple cloud providers and on-premises environments using a declarative configuration language (HCL). It helps automate the creation, updating, and destruction of resources like VMs, networks, storage, etc., ensuring infrastructure is versioned, repeatable, and predictable.
